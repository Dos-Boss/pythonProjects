Assessment Tasks:

Code a file called 2d-list.py to create an array (or 2D list) called temps containing a month (31 days) 
of simulated hourly temperature readings taken to one decimal point. 
Use the Gaussian random function from Python’s random module.

Once the array has been populated, continue with the following questions:

a) Write code to display the average temperature at noon 

b) Sort the existing array of daily temps in ascending order (hint: use Python’s built in sort() method)

c) Code your own binary search algorithm as a new function defined as follows, 
   Also write a comment just above the function definition with a short description of how it works.
   binarySearch(list, item) 

d) Use your binary search to find out if the 5th day recorded a specific temp (eg. 21.1 degrees; pick your own value)

e) Print two lists, one showing all the daily highs and another the daily lows.
